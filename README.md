Features of the program. The program will launch a UI. To select a file, Click "Select Board". If a board has invalid input, nothing will be displayed. 
To export a file, click on the button that says export.

Bugs(Because I believe in being honest): 
The program will only handle invalid input on launch. It is possible to load up several different files in the same app execution but a bad one will break the program
The program does solve all the test cases. I ran into a bug and was unable to figure out to properly manage my state for a backtracing program

Ultimatly I think I spent too much time on the UI in the hopes that I could get some bonus points and as a result this hurt what the assignment was fundamentally about. 
I have dedicated a significant amount of time into this program and hope you will evaluate the bonus categories despite flaws in my state management. 

TEMPLATE METHOD PATTERN IS the SUDOKU SOLVER Class.
