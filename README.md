Features of the program. The program will launch a UI. To select a file, Click "Select Board". If a board has invalid input, nothing will be displayed. 
To export a file, click on the button that says export.

Bugs: 
The program will only handle invalid input on launch. It is possible to load up several different files in the same app execution but a bad one will break the program
The program does solve all the test cases. I ran into a bug and was unable to figure out to properly manage my state for a backtracing program

TEMPLATE METHOD PATTERN IS the SUDOKU SOLVER Class.
